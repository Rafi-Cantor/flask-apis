# Python Flask APIs

Flask backend with AWS Cognito authentication and JWT-based auth, structured using Flask Blueprints for modular apps (auth, chat, etc.). Uses a data mapper pattern with PostgreSQL for clean separation of business and persistence logic, and is being extended with a real-time chat app using Flask-SocketIO to explore WebSockets and event-driven systems.
